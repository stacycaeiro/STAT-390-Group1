Displayed values of zero may represent small values that round to zero.  The Excel version of this table provides additional precision which may be accessed by selecting individual cells.
Coal generation and consumption includes anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite, waste coal, refined coal, synthetic coal, and coal-derived synthesis gas.
Petroleum Liquids includes distillate fuel oil, residual fuel oil, jet fuel, kerosene, propane, and waste oil.
Petroleum Coke includes petroleum coke and synthesis gas derived from petroleum coke. 
Natural gas includes a small amount of supplemental gaseous fuels that cannot be identified separately.
Other Fossil Gas includes gaseous propane, blast furnace gas, other manufactured and waste gases derived from fossil fuels other than hydrogen.
Wood and Wood-Derived Fuels include wood, black liquor, and other wood waste.
Other Biomass includes biogenic municipal solid waste, landfill gas, sludge waste, agricultural byproducts, and other biomass.
Other Energy Sources includes hydrogen, non-biogenic municipal solid waste, batteries, purchased steam, sulfur, tire-derived fuel, and other miscellaneous energy sources.
Coal stocks include anthracite, bituminous, subbituminous, lignite, refined coal, and synthetic coal; waste coal is excluded.
Sales of electricity to ultimate customers and net generation may not correspond exactly for a particular month for a variety of reasons (e.g., sales data may include imported electricity).
Net generation is presented for the calendar month while sales of electricity to ultimate customers and associated revenue accumulate from bills collected for periods of time that vary depending
upon customer class and consumption occurring during and outside the calendar month.
Note: Values are final. Percentage change is calculated before rounding.

Facility Direct Sales to ultimate customers typically represent bilateral electric power sales between industrial and commercial generating facilities.
Direct Use represents commercial and industrial facility use of onsite net electricity generation; electricity sales or transfers to adjacent or co-located facilities; and barter transactions. Losses and Unaccounted For includes: (1) reporting by utilities and power marketers that represent losses incurred in transmission and distribution, as well as volumes unaccounted for in their own energy balance; and (2) discrepancies among the differing categories upon balancing the table.
Totals may not equal sum of components because of independent rounding.
